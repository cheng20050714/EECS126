    "In this lab, we simulate the growth and evolution of vegetation in coastal areas and try to understand how biological evolution is affected by gene type, rate of mutation, land type, and other variants. To do so, we will set up a world and treat plants as particles. At each time step, these plants will reproduce and compete with each other for the limited space, in the process passing on the fitter genes.\n",

    "The first step to our simulation is to build the world. But how do we generate elevations and lanscapes that look realistic? A lot of research has been poured into this, and one method which has been successful is Perlin noise, which you can read more about on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) and this [blog post](https://flafla2.github.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html). It is used in both animated movies and Minecraft, and we will use it too in this lab. Below you will find perlin noise in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions.\n",
