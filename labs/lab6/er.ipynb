The intuition here is that we want to **minimize** friendships across communities, as under our assumptions, **p > q** so it is more likely to be friends within a community than across. Notice, if we assume that **p < q**, then we would have been interested in the max-bisection.\n",

This is called the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of the partition given the graph G. It is an interesting exercise to prove this which you can try if you would like. You will prove this result in homework when we go over Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Maximum A Posteriori Estimation."
